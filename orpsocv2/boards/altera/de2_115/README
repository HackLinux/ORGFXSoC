DE2-115 port
============

Build:

    Setup the OpenRisc toolchain: http://opencores.org/openrisc,gnu_toolchain. You'll only need or32-elf- for now.
    git clone git://github.com/lgeek/orpsoc.git
    cd orpsoc/boards/altera/de2_115/syn/quartus/run
    ALTERA_PATH=/path/to/altera make all

Program board:
    ALTERA_PATH=/path/to/altera make pgm

JTAG:
    Go to http://opencores.org/download,adv_debug_sys and download it. You'll need to create an account. Accounts are approved manually. Or use my mirror on github:
    git clone git@github.com:lgeek/adv_debug_sys.git
    cd adv_debug_sys/Software/adv_jtag_bridge
    Edit Makefile and change the BUILD_ENVIRONMENT setting if necessary.
    make
    wget ftp://ftp.altera.com/outgoing/download/bsdl/EP4CE115F29.bsd
    ./adv_jtag_bridge -b ./ usbblaster

Debug:
    Start or32-elf-gdb. Inside gdb: target remote :9999. That's it.

U-Boot:
   Instructions to build it here: http://opencores.org/or1k/U-Boot. Use the de0_nano config.
   Inside gdb:
   load /path/to/u-boot-dir/u-boot
   set $pc=0x100
   continue
   You should have the U-Boot shell running over the serial port @ 115200 baud

Known issues:
   JTAG seems to be a bit unstable. It is usable, but you'll sometimes have to reconnect the bridge.
   The bootrom code which should just loop doesn't seem to work.

Plans:
   Add SPI controller connected to MMC SPI pins. Enable mmc_spi in u-boot.
   Enable the second SDRAM chip.
   Add Ethernet core(s)

Credits:
   All the hard work was done by the guys writing the actual cores at opencores.org and by Stefan who ported ORPSoC to DE0-Nano (http://git.openrisc.net/cgit.cgi/stefan/u-boot/) and has been most helpful giving me pointers on how to get this port working. All I've done was to change a couple of settings and write these instructions.
